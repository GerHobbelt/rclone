# Generated API client code and notes

Using [oapi-codegen](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen).

## TODO

* [x] auth, via custom RequestEditorFn, as we need a CSRF token for each
  request; cf. https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/#using-securityproviders
* [ ] transitional "oapi" wrapper, that look just like the current api, but
      uses the generated code under the hood
